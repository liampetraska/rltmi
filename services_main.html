				<h2>What does RLT have to offer?</h2>
				<p>
					RLT offers a variety of different services depending on your current financial situation. Whether you're close to retirement or looking to save up for college for your children, RLT can help. Below are just a few of the services RLT provides. You don't have to go it alone.

							<h2>Estate Planning</h2>
							<p>
								<img src="images/estate_planning.jpg" align="left" style="padding:0 15px 0 0" alt="">
								You already have a Revocable Living Trust?  RLT will come and do an “Administrative Review”.  RLT will discuss any issues you might have and questions you need answered and then discuss them with the Estate Attorney.  With the Administrative Review, RLT will also look to make sure documents have been witnessed, notarized and signed.  This is a very important process.  There are always new laws and changes that happen.  Make sure your trust is up-to-date.
								<br><br>
								A trust written by a leading “Estate Attorney” will include all of the following; the naming of the Successor Trustees, listing of the Beneficiaries and Powers of Attorney set up for both medical and financial.  Examples of other areas covered are; a Pour over will, a Living Will, a Quit Claim Deed, and a Trust Agreement, just to name a few.  Every trust is custom written for each client’s unique and individual needs.  Once the Trust is delivered to you and signed by you, it will then be witnessed and notarized. <br><br>
								Death Settlements: We will come visit you and/ or your family to follow the steps laid out by the attorneys to help with this time of loss.  When you have a Trust, you need the help and support to make sure all involved are moving forward in the right direction.  RLT is experienced in these steps and can help during this time of need.
