					<h2>Welcome to RLT<i> Retirement and Estate Planning!</i></h2>
					
					<p>As you spend a few minutes with us here, take a moment and ask yourself these simple questions....<br>
					<br>
					<b><i>“Am I on the right path for retirement?”<br><br>
					“If something happens to me, what happens to my family financially?”<br><br>
					“Is my estate set up properly?  Will it go through Probate?  Will my family have big legal bills when my day comes?”<br><br>
					“Will my estate create more stress and more problems for my family at a time when they need to pick up their lives and move forward?”<br>
					<br></i></b>
					We feel these are very important questions to ask ourselves.  Remember, it’s not IF that day will come, but WHEN.  One day, every one of us will leave behind a legacy.  The question then will become, <b><i>“is it a well-planned and prepared legacy OR will it be an expensive, stressful time for my family and my loved ones because I am not prepared?”</b></i> <br>
					<br>
					RLT has partnered with top Attorneys and Tax Advisors in the field of “Retirement and Estate Planning”.  In today’s changing economic times, the laws affecting our estates and our finances are being continuously revised.  New taxes and unpredictable government directions make it extremely important that we have the most current and accurate information available to us to make the right decisions.  We all need to know what these changes mean and how they affect us and our loved ones.  We need to know that we have the help we need right here.  RLT and our support staff are always up to date with these changes.  We all work together to make sure you and your family are prepared.  You have worked very hard your whole life.  Don’t let a lack of preparation cause your family stress and a large percentage of your estate.  RLT is the first step in making sure YOU are making the decisions that impact your estate not the courts.  <br> 
					<br>
					Look around our website and then send me a note or a question.  I am looking forward to talking to you and meeting you.  Thank you,<br>
					<br>

					<b>Our testimonials</b>
					<p>
						“...we had no idea that we needed so much more than a will.  Ron was referred to us by a friend and when we called him, he came right to our home.  He worked real close with us and with the attorney every step of the way.  There was so much that we didn’t understand. We both feel so much better knowing our estate has been planned.”
					</p>
					<a href="#">- Gary & Bonnie, Ingham County</a><br><br><br>
					<p>
						“...I lost my dad in February and my mother in June.  A few years ago, Ron met with us to help set up a Living Trust for mom and Dad.  It was the best decision they made.  I can’t image the stress and the cost I would have had to deal with if the trust didn’t exist.   Thank you so much Ron”
					</p>
					<a href="#">- James, Battle Creek</a><br><br><br>
					<p>
						“...I just retired, I wasn’t sure what to do with my 401k.  I had lots of questions and ideas. Ron had handled my mom’s Living Trust, so I called him.  He and his support team came up with a great plan and now I have a monthly income guaranteed for the rest of my life and my wife will also be set if something was to happen to me.”
